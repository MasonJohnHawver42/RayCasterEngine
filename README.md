# Demos on Desmos

Demos on desmos showcassing the math used to calculate the values nessasary to render a scene on the screen.

 - ray caster demo - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/8h3dkoubzj ( how the distance to the walls is found )

 - sprites demo - https://www.desmos.com/calculator/gfdjpd1vzu ( how the dis and height / size of the sprites are found so they can be drawn. )

# Future Updates

1) real time wall and player collisions (harder (depending on the decided method))
2) variable wall heights (hard - have to work out the maths for it and change the rendering method in the camera classs)
3) variable actor heights ( med - just have to change the rendering method in the camera a bit, andd think about the maths for this a tad)
3) textured floors and cellings ( really hard - new maths & I have no idea on how to aproach this, exspecially with variable wall heights and variable actor heights too !!!)
